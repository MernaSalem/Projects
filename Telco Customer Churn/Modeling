Baseline Models
Logistic Regression provides a simple baseline and highlights the impact of class imbalance. Recall is crucial because missing churners is more costly than false positives.
Key Observations
Accuracy alone would overestimate performance (~80%+)
Recall is critical — missing churners = business cost
Decision Tree captures some non-linear effects better than Logistic Regression
Baseline establishes starting point for improvement
Hyperparameter tuning
Ensemble models
Class imbalance handling (class weights, oversampling)

What the model is telling:
1. Contract Type dominates
Month-to-month customers churn far more
Long-term contracts act as churn friction
This is structural, not behavioral.
2. Tenure is protective
New customers are fragile
Risk drops sharply after the first year
Early lifecycle matters more than price.
3. MonthlyCharges increases churn risk
Especially when combined with:
Fiber optic
Missing support services
High cost without perceived value triggers exits.
4. Support add-ons reduce churn

"We analyzed customer churn using structured EDA, built baseline and ensemble models, addressed class imbalance, evaluated with ROC-AUC and PR-AUC, and translated predictions into targeted retention strategies driven by interpretable signals."
