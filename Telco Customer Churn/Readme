What customer churn is (in this dataset)

Why predicting churn matters financially

What success means (early detection, not raw accuracy)

The churn class is imbalanced (about ~26.6% churned vs ~73.4% stayed). That means naïve accuracy is extremely misleading.
The dataset exhibits a clear class imbalance, with approximately 26.54% of customers having churned. This makes accuracy an unreliable evaluation metric and motivates the use of recall, precision, and F1-score.

The dataset is moderately sized and dominated by categorical features. Initial inspection shows potential data type issues, particularly with TotalCharges.
