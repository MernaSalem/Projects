Grouped feature importance and combined features effect plot
This paper introduces novel frameworks for **grouped feature importance** and **combined feature effects** to improve the interpretability of machine learning models in high-dimensional settings. 
The authors argue that evaluating features in **pre-defined groups**—based on domain knowledge or data-driven clusters—reduces information overload and computational costs compared to individual feature analysis. 
They propose several model-agnostic methods, including **grouped permutation importance (GPFI)** and **Shapley values for groups (GSI)**, alongside a **sequential procedure** to identify the most predictive combinations of groups. 
Additionally, they present the **Combined Features Effect Plot (CFEP)**, which utilizes **sparse supervised principal component analysis** to visualize how collective groups of variables influence model predictions. 
The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated through simulations and a **real-world smartphone sensor dataset** used to predict human personality traits. 
Overall, the research provides a structured approach for managing **correlated predictors** and complex interactions by shifting focus from single variables to meaningful functional units.
Based on the provided sources, grouped feature importance differs from single feature analysis in several fundamental conceptual and methodological ways. Primarily, grouped interpretations provide a mechanism to handle high-dimensional data 
and correlated features where single-feature analysis might be misleading or computationally infeasible.

**Conceptual Differences and Interpretation**
The most critical distinction is that grouped and single feature interpretations measure different phenomena and are usually not directly comparable.

*   **Handling Correlation and Interactions:** Analyzing single features can be misleading when features are highly correlated or interact with one another. 
For instance, permutation feature importance (PFI) on a single feature can be problematic because it may force the model to extrapolate into regions where no observations exist. 
Grouped analysis mitigates this by allowing users to group correlated features (e.g., those from the same sensor or semantic area) and assess their joint effect, preserving the internal structure of the group.

*   **Information Management:** In high-dimensional settings with hundreds of features, single-feature analysis results in "information overload," making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model. 
Grouped analysis reduces dimensionality, offering a feasible remedy for visualizing effects and understanding key drivers.

*   **Contextual Meaning:** Grouped analysis is particularly useful when features naturally belong together, such as dummy-encoded categorical variables (one-hot encoding). 
Analyzing a single dummy variable (e.g., one binary column of a categorical feature) is often less meaningful than analyzing the categorical feature as a whole group.

**Methodological Differences**
The mathematical definition and calculation of importance scores differ when moving from single features to groups:

*   **Permutation Methods (PFI vs. GPFI):**
    *   *Single:* Measures the increase in loss after permuting one feature, breaking its association with the target and all other features.
    *   *Grouped:* The Grouped Permutation Feature Importance (GPFI) permutes all features within a group **jointly**. 
This breaks the association between the group and the target (and other groups) but preserves the dependencies and correlations *within* the group itself.

*   **Refitting Methods (LOCO vs. LOGO):**
    *   *Single:* Requires removing one feature and retraining the model to see if performance drops.
    *   *Grouped:* The Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) method removes an entire set of features and retrains the model. 
This assesses whether the *group* contains unique information required for model performance that is not present in the remaining groups.

*   **Shapley Values (SHAP vs. GSI):**
    *   *Single:* Distributes payouts to individual features. Computation does not scale linearly and can be infeasible for high-dimensional data.
    *   *Grouped:* Grouped Shapley Importance (GSI) treats groups as the players in the game. While GSI provides a fair distribution of importance among groups, it cannot always be exactly decomposed into the sum of single-feature Shapley scores. 
The difference (or remainder) between the GSI and the sum of single-feature importances represents the higher-order interaction effects between features of the regarded group and features of *other* groups.

**Group Definition**
Unlike single feature analysis, which uses the feature space "as is," grouped analysis requires defining structure beforehand. This can be done via:
1.  **Knowledge-driven grouping:** Using domain knowledge (e.g., grouping gene expressions by biological function or smartphone data by usage category).
2.  **Data-driven grouping:** Using algorithms like clustering to group statistically similar or correlated features.

What are the advantages of using knowledge-driven versus data-driven grouping?

The choice between knowledge-driven and data-driven grouping depends largely on the availability of domain information and the specific goals regarding interpretability versus statistical management of the feature space.

**Advantages of Knowledge-Driven Grouping**
The primary advantage of knowledge-driven grouping is **superior interpretability**. By using domain knowledge to define the grouping structure, the resulting dimensionality reduction is often more meaningful to researchers than groups derived purely from data. 
Specific benefits include:

*   **Semantic Relevance:** Groups are formed based on shared semantic areas (e.g., biomarkers in medicine or behavioral classes in psychology) or common data generation mechanisms (e.g., all features from a specific sensor or device like an fMRI or smartphone),. 
This allows users to assess the "joint effect" of features that naturally belong together.
*   **Contextual Application:** This approach is particularly useful when a grouping structure is available *a priori* based on the application context, allowing for hypothesis testing regarding specific theoretical constructs (e.g., "mobility" vs. "social activity"),.
*   **Handling Specific Data Types:** It provides a remedy for datasets where single-feature interpretation is misleading, such as with dummy-encoded categorical variables or time-lagged features, which naturally constitute a single group,.

**Advantages of Data-Driven Grouping**
Data-driven grouping, which employs algorithmic approaches like hierarchical or fuzzy clustering, is advantageous when **no natural grouping is known in advance** or when managing statistical redundancy is the priority,. 
Specific benefits include:

*   **Managing High Correlation:** This method excels in highly correlated feature spaces, such as genomics or medicine. By grouping correlated features based on statistical similarity, practitioners ensure that relevant information is not discarded, which can happen if correlated features are treated individually.
*   **Feature Selection:** Data-driven methods can be used to identify informative representatives within groups of statistically similar features (e.g., selecting distinct genes from microarray data).

**Key Trade-off**
While data-driven grouping effectively handles statistical correlations, its main disadvantage is that the resulting groups depend solely on **statistical similarity**, which may not coincide with domain-specific interpretations. 
Conversely, knowledge-driven grouping prioritizes the topical character of the data, potentially yielding insights that are more actionable in a real-world context.
